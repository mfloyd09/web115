	<h2>CPCC EVA Course Contract</h2>

	<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Marlaine Floyd</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2021 WEB115-N801:
	   Web Markup and Scripting	course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
	   
	<p>I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly
	   available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for 
	   schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. </p>
	   
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or
	   showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
	   
	<p>Signed: Marlaine Floyd, 16/08/2021</p>

<ul> 
<li>Personal background: I am a North Carolina native, and have lived in Charlotte since 2012. I’ve worked in bars and restaurants for most of my young adult life and I am now seeking a career in IT concentrating in Digital Forensics and Information Assurance. </li> 
<li>Academic background:  I graduated from Surry Central High School in 2012 and then attended UNCC on and off for 3 years before enrolling at CPCC for a more affordable higher education.</li>
<li>Background in this subject:  I took WEB110 in the 2021 Spring semester, but other than messing around with the coding on social media profiles, I must admit I don’t have much of a background in this subject.</li>
<li>Primary Computer Platform:  MAC OS that also runs Windows 10. </li>
<li>Courses I'm Taking & Why:<ul>
	<li>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting</li>
	<li>WEB120 - Intro to Internet Multimedia</li>
	<li>WEB210 - Web Design</li></ul>
<li>Reason for taking these classes is of course because they are required, even though my concentration is Digital Forensics and Information Assurance. I am curious to see how these courses apply to my overall degree and happy that I get the opportunity to learn more about coding. </li>
<li>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: When I first came to Charlotte I was a visual art major at UNCC. </li>
